# InventoryAppAdmin
Angular-enabled list of inventory items for a store plus inputs to add a new item.

Using data in an array, this app shows inventory items for a shop. It also sorts the items by number in inventory. In addition, a new item can be added to the inventory, and shown in the list, but completing the input fields. 

This was the second homework project done using Angular.
